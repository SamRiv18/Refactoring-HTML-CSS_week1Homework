# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

**Description**
The main task of this project was to refactor existing code. The end prodect needed to make the site more accessible as well as making improvments to the code. We were introduced to the scout rule and how to exceed the expecations of any given task. 

**HTML File**
The first modification was done in line 6 when I decided to link a reset css file to the project. This was done as good practice as since it overights any styling the browser might have as a default. By doing this you increase the consistance of your site across platforms thus adding to the accessibility. The next edit came in line 8 when I added a more descriptive title to the page.
The purpose of the following modifications done to the html file were to add sematic HTML elements. Adding meaning to the tags would contribute to simplifying the code in a way that is easy to read. I also deleted some classes as there were better labeled as id's since they were unique and only used once. Another modification was adding alt attributes to the image, making it more accesible if the images can't be found. Finally I added comments which seperated each major section of the site. 

**CSS File**
Majority of the modifications were made in the CSS file. I began by adding comments to each section, detailing the elements that were being changed by the styling sheet. After that I changed the corresponding classes to id's, a changed mentioned in the **HTML File**. Many of these new id's used the same styles so I grouped them together, thus condencing the CSS file which eliminated redundancy. I also grouped the rules that affected similar classes (ex. .header is next to .header h1 and so forth).
